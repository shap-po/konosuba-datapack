This part of the datapack removes all recipes added by the Waystones mod and replaces `attuned_shard.json` and `crumbling_attuned_shard.json` recipes with custom ones.

For some reason, removing these recipes with a filter inside `pack.mcmeta` results in problems such as warp plates not dropping when broken.
